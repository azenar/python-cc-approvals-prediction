# Predicting Credit Card Approvals
Manually analyzing lot of applications for credit cards is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming. This project aims to build an automatic credit card approval predictor using *machine learning techniques* just like the real bank does so nowadays.

The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Approval dataset] from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

## Skillsets (but not limited to) for this project:
- Data Importing
- Data Cleaning
- Data Manipulation

- Applied Finance

## Modules/libraries used for this project:
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn (sklearn)
